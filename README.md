Patient-centered Information Commons (PIC) aims to create a massively scalable toolkit to enable large, 
multi-center Patient-centered Information Commons (PIC) at local, regional, and national scale, where 
the focus is the alignment of all available biomedical data per individual. Such a Commons is a 
prerequisite for conducting the large-N, Big Data, longitudinal studies essential for understanding 
causation in the Precision Medicine framework while simultaneously addressing key complexities of the 
Patient-Centric Outcome Research studies required under ACA (Affordable Care Act). Our proposal is 
solidly grounded in our experience over the last 25 years of harnessing clinical care data to the research enterprise.
